# Dark Matter for Don't Starve Together
Adds Dark Motes, Dark Matter and Dark Pylon to the game.

Dark Motes are a new currency obtained from most raw materials. You can either get them by crafting them using Gold Nuggets, or placing raw materials in a Dark Pylon.

The Dark Pylon can be crafted using Dark Motes and converts the materials placed inside into more Dark Motes, based on the values set in the options.

Dark Matter can also be crafted using Dark Motes. When dropped on the ground, it will break, do some random damage to the player, and release random materials, hostile mobs, or even bosses.

There's a 5% chance that it will spawn one of the mobs below, and a 0.1% chance that it will spawn one of the bosses.

Mobs: Bat, Bishop, Fire Hound, Frog, Ghost, Hound, Ice Hound, Killer Bee, Knight, Krampus, Bunnyman, Merm, Monkey, Werewolf, Mosquito, Rock Lobster, Rook, Tallbird, Slurtle, Spider, Spider Warrior, Nurse Spider, Cave Spider, Spitter

Bosses: Bearger, Deerclops, Treeguard, Spider Queen, Ewecus, Varg
